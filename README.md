## Problem statement

Efficiently query and analyze multiple PDF documents using the power of Google Gemini Pro and Langchain, leveraging FAISS vector embeddings for superior semantic search. Deploy the application seamlessly with Streamlit for easy user access.

## Highlighting the User-Friendly Aspect

PDFs are notoriously difficult to search and analyze at scale. We'll tackle this challenge by building a user-friendly LLM application that combines Google Gemini Pro's language understanding with Langchain's framework and FAISS's efficient embeddings. Deploy the application with Streamlit for an intuitive interface anyone can use.
